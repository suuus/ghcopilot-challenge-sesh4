# Challenge 3: Shopping Cart Integration Testing

## Objective
Create and test a shopping cart system that integrates multiple components and requires integration testing.

## Requirements

1. Implement these components:
   - `Product` class
   - `Cart` class
   - `DiscountService`
   - `InventoryService`

2. The system should:
   - Add/remove products from cart
   - Calculate totals with discounts
   - Check inventory availability
   - Apply promotional codes

## Steps

1. Write integration tests first
2. Implement the components
3. Test the interaction between components
4. Handle edge cases and error scenarios

## Success Criteria
- Integration tests pass
- Components work together correctly
- Proper error handling
- Edge cases covered (empty cart, invalid promos, out of stock)

## Tips
- Use Copilot to help design the integration tests
- Ask about testing patterns for complex systems
- Consider dependency injection for testing
- Think about test isolation
