[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/suuus/challenge-sesh4)

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot Testing Challenge! This exercise is designed to help you practice using GitHub Copilot for test-driven development and various testing scenarios.

## Overview

This challenge consists of 3 progressively difficult exercises that will help you explore:
- Writing unit tests with GitHub Copilot
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Integration testing
- Mock creation and usage
- Improving test coverage

## Time Required
- Approximately 20 minutes total
- Each challenge should take about 6-7 minutes

## Challenges

1. [Basic Unit Testing](./challenges/challenge1/README.md) - String manipulation and basic assertions
2. [Intermediate Testing](./challenges/challenge2/README.md) - Working with mocks and async operations
3. [Advanced Testing](./challenges/challenge3/README.md) - Integration testing and complex scenarios

## Getting Started

There are two ways to get started:

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
1. Click the "Code" button above
2. Select "Create codespace on main"
3. Wait for the codespace to be created and VS Code to load
4. When prompted, install the recommended CodeTour extension
5. Open the Command Palette (F1 or Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P)
6. Type "CodeTour: Start Tour" and select it
7. Follow the guided tour through each challenge

### Option 2: Local Development
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start with Challenge 1 and progress through each challenge
4. Use GitHub Copilot to help you write tests and implement solutions
5. Run tests using `npm test`

## Interactive Guided Tour

This repository includes a CodeTour that will walk you through each challenge step by step. To use it:

1. Make sure you have the [CodeTour extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) installed in VS Code
2. Look for the CodeTour panel in your sidebar or use the Command Palette to "Start Tour"
3. Follow along with the interactive guide that will help you navigate through each challenge

## Tips for Using GitHub Copilot

- Use Copilot Chat to ask questions about testing approaches
- Try using Copilot to generate test cases
- Use Copilot to help implement the actual functions based on your tests
- Experiment with Copilot's test generation capabilities

Good luck and happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
